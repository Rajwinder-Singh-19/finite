# Finite Element Method Framework in Python
Easy to use Object Oriented API to solve engineering problems (structural as of now) in Python using Finite Element Method (FEM)

## Progress So Far

### Implementation of Truss Structure
Truss system modeled using an Object Oriented API for both elements and the system to be solved.
